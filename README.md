# Vork

Vork will eventually be a fully fledged V implementation, including parser, compiler and interpreter (and maybe more
will see how much time I will have)

Right now it is only the parser and interpreter, once I get the interpreter to have all/most of V's features I will
move on to work on a compiler.
